# Code of Conduct

## Seriously, You Expected a Code of Conduct?

Let’s be real—this is just a fun project agar Hackathon me select nahi hota to. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- **No Drama**: We’re not here to win Oscars. Keep the drama for your next Netflix binge.
- **Be Kind**: Treat others like you’d treat your favorite pizza—with love and lots of toppings!
- **Have Fun**: If it’s not fun, what are we even doing? Let’s keep the vibes high and the memes higher.

If you break these rules, we might just kick you out of our imaginary pizza party. So, let’s keep it chill and enjoy the ride!
